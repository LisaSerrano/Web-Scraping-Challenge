 # Web Scraping and Data Analysis Project

## Background
This project involves full web scraping and data analysis. You'll use tools like Splinter for automated browsing and Beautiful Soup for HTML parsing to extract information from websites. The project focuses on scraping Mars news articles and weather data, followed by analysis using Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib.

## Objectives
1. Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
2. Scrape and analyze Mars weather data from a table.

## Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
1. Use automated browsing to visit the Mars news site and inspect the page.
2. Extract titles and preview text of news articles using Beautiful Soup.
3. Store the scraped data in Python dictionaries and lists.
4. Optionally, export the data to a JSON file.

## Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
1. Use automated browsing to visit the Mars temperature data site and inspect the page.
2. Scrape data from the HTML table using Beautiful Soup.
3. Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame.
4. Analyze the dataset to answer specific questions:
    - Number of months on Mars
    - Number of Martian days worth of data
    - Coldest and warmest months on Mars
    - Months with the lowest and highest atmospheric pressure
    - Terrestrial days in a Martian year
5. Visualize the results using Matplotlib.
6. Export the DataFrame to a CSV file.

## Conclusion
By completing this project, you'll enhance your skills in web scraping, data analysis, and visualization. The final deliverables will provide valuable insights into Mars news and weather data.
